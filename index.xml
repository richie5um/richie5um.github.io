      <description>Took the kids out to Manchester Airport Visitors Park. I expected them to get bored quickly, but, instead, they were still enjoying it 3 hours later.
My friend came over too. We had fun and got some nice photos.</description>

      <description>I been a keen photographer for many years. It started with a film camera, developoing black &amp;amp; white photos in the darkroom. The feeling when you develop your contact prints and then see the full-sized photo emerge from the chemicals; I love that process.
For over 3 years I took a photo every day and posted it to Blipfoto. They was a massive help in seeing photos, as the pressure of it being daily forces you to look everywhere for a photo.</description>

      <description>Hi.
I live and work near Manchester, UK.
For work, I&amp;rsquo;m a CTO at Summize working on Legal Contract Management solution. I love the dynamic and creative nature when collaborating with a team to birth new v1 products.
Previously at AppSense/Ivanti I was Head of Research; leading a small, skilled team to identify and solve complex problems, and explore next generation markets and technologies. As exciting and free as that role was, shipping real software to real users is what I enjoy most.</description>

      <title>Updating a website</title>
      <link>http://www.richsomerfield.com/blog/2017-05-10-new-site/</link>

      <description>Introduction Last time I switch the design of my blog, I switched to Hugo. After a bit of theme customization I had a pretty good working system. However, it didn&amp;rsquo;t take long until I tweaked one of the static generated output files.
This tweaking continued for the next few years&amp;hellip; until now.
I&amp;rsquo;ve stuck with Hugo, but have chosen a different theme and made my customizations - mostly to make it work like a fully functioning website (with a blog), and not just a &amp;lsquo;single page site&amp;rsquo;, or a &amp;lsquo;blog with an simple about page&amp;rsquo;.</description>

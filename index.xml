      <description>Took the kids out to Manchester Airport Visitors Park. I expected them to get bored quickly, but, instead, they were still enjoying it 3 hours later.
My friend came over too. We had fun and got some nice photos.</description>

      <description>I been a keen photographer for many years. It started with a film camera, developoing black &amp;amp; white photos in the darkroom. The feeling when you develop your contact prints and then see the full-sized photo emerge from the chemicals; I love that process.
For over 3 years I took a photo every day and posted it to Blipfoto. They was a massive help in seeing photos, as the pressure of it being daily forces you to look everywhere for a photo.</description>

      <description>Hi.
I live and work near Manchester, UK.
For work, I&amp;rsquo;m a Principal Software Engineer at Ivanti (nee LANDESK, nee AppSense) mostly working on shipping v1 products - the three most recent projects have involved; cloud technologies (AWS, Azure), web-UI, web-services, and Windows/Mac agents. I love the dynamic and creative nature when collaborating with a team to birth new v1 products.
Previously at AppSense I was Head of Research; leading a small, skilled team to identify and solve complex problems, and explore next generation markets and technologies.</description>

      <title>Updating a website</title>
      <link>http://www.richsomerfield.com/blog/2017-05-10-new-site/</link>

      <description>Introduction Last time I switch the design of my blog, I switched to Hugo. After a bit of theme customization I had a pretty good working system. However, it didn&amp;rsquo;t take long until I tweaked one of the static generated output files.
This tweaking continued for the next few years&amp;hellip; until now.
I&amp;rsquo;ve stuck with Hugo, but have chosen a different theme and made my customizations - mostly to make it work like a fully functioning website (with a blog), and not just a &amp;lsquo;single page site&amp;rsquo;, or a &amp;lsquo;blog with an simple about page&amp;rsquo;.</description>

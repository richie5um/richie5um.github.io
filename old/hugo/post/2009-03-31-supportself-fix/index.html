		<h5>Support/Self-Fix</h5>
	  </div>

	  <div class="post">
		<p>When was the last time you contacted a Support team for help with an application?</p>

<p>I know for me it is very rarely.</p>

<p>When I encounter a problem with an application, the first thing I do, is to try and resolve the problem myself. If this fails, and the problem still exists, I&rsquo;ll speak to other people (usually colleagues) to see if they have encountered it. And thirdly, I&rsquo;ll scour the internet looking for an alternative product.  Very very rarely, even more so if the software hasn&rsquo;t cost <strong><em>me</em></strong> anything, will I consider contacting the relevant Support team.</p>

<p>Why is this important?</p>

<p>Well, as you know, I&rsquo;m a Software Developer/Engineer/Programmer.  And therefore, I&rsquo;m responsible for producing products that may encounter the very same users as myself.  With this in mind, it becomes even more important to make sure the product is usable, especially when it is having problems - which sounds counter-intuitive.  Perhaps supporting all of the following charactistics would help:</p>

<ul>
<li>Intuitive to use.</li>
<li>Intuitive to use, when having problems.</li>
<li>Obvious how to diagnose problems (a &ldquo;.log&rdquo; file in an obvious directory, with clear log messages).</li>
<li>Help is easy to launch.</li>
<li>Help presents an easy to use &ldquo;Submit problem&rdquo; .</li>
<li>Help is context sensitive.</li>
<li>Help is scenario based, rather than a disection of each individual UI component.</li>
</ul>

<p>[There are many more, but these are the most obvious that currently spring to mind.]</p>

<p>Now, the self-fix approach probably differs when it is a business critical, and/or you&rsquo;ve paid good money for it.  But I&rsquo;d guess that even in these situations, a good proportion still attempt self-fix first.</p>

<p>This situation arose very recently for me.  I was using a particular Virtual Machine (Type2 Hypervisor) technology, and couldn&rsquo;t get a Virtual Machine to boot without hanging.  I ran through my self-fix steps, and ended up wasting a decent amount of time before finally switching to another product - which worked first time.  Now, I&rsquo;m fairly sure that the problem was something to do with my machine, as I&rsquo;ve used that original product for a long time without any issues, and have only encounter this problem since changing laptops.  But, the end result was that I&rsquo;ve lost faith in that product, and will be unlikely to try it again for a significant period of time.  And this is all without even contacting Support.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d be interest to hear if you are the same as me, or if you fully utilize Support.</p>

		<h5>My Computer History</h5>
	  </div>

	  <div class="post">
		<p>I&rsquo;ve always been interested in computers.  It started as a child when my dad bought a Amstrad CPC 464 computer - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_CPC">Wikipedia</a>.  Apart from the obvious &ldquo;HelloWorld&#8221; coding, my first really useful bit of development was when my dad bought a disk-drive for the Amstrad (the 464 was tape driven).  He&rsquo;d already bought a word-processor - from Dixons if I remember correctly - which was on a tape.  When we got the disk-drive, I managed to hack into the word-processor code (using the equivalent of Ctrl-Break, which as the source was loaded into memory, gave you direct access to it), using this I re-worked it so that it would use the disk-drive.  Not spectacular, but I was impressed with myself, and was intregued by what computers could do for me.</p>

<p>I remember going to my local library and looking for books on programming - there never seemed to be any.  Compare that to today when they is so much information it is a challenge just working out what is useful and what is not.</p>

<p>After the Amstrad my dad got a PC.  An ICL  286, with 100MB hard drive - which had to be partitioned into 32MB blocks.</p>

<p>Eventually, I ended up at University of Manchester, studing Computer Science.  I had a great three years and left with a top degree.  Following this I spent 9 months working for a company supplying solutions to the MoD, I learnt a bit, but was really frustrated that I couldn&rsquo;t just do things - so I left.</p>

<p>I then moved into the Telecoms sector, developing technology to process, consolidate and manage call records.  I really enjoyed this job, but unfortunately my office was closed as part of the telecoms crash of the early 2000&rsquo;s.  Within a few weeks of my redundancy I&rsquo;d managed to get a job at a security firm (SurfControl), which was developing solutions for the Windows platform.  This was the first time I&rsquo;d developed anything for Windows, and it was to be a steep learning curve.  My first piece of code for this company was fairly rubbish, but I learned a lot from this experience.  Given the sector we were in, and the solutions we were developing, we were all exposed to some pretty interesting and complex stuff.  After 5 years at this company, and learning a great deal, I was again made redundant (due to the company being bought by our nearest competitor).</p>

<p>My next employer is also my current employer.  For the first year I worked on a client side virtualization technology - exposing me to the compexities of working inside other peoples software.  I&rsquo;ve since changed roles, and am now the Software Research Team Lead.</p>

<p>At home, I use an iMac - which feels completely different to Windows, I&rsquo;ll write a post in the future with my feelings about the two different platforms.</p>

<p>I hope this gives you a bit of background about me.  If you want any more info, let me know and I&rsquo;ll follow up with a more detailed piece.</p>

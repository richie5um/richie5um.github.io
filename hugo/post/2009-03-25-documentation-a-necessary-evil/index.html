		<h5>Documentation - A Necessary Evil?</h5>
	  </div>

	  <div class="post">
		<p>Throughout my career as a developer, many things have changed. But the one common thread that I&rsquo;ve always encountered is a significant number of my fellow developers stating how much they &ldquo;hate documentation&rdquo;.
The problem isn&rsquo;t necessarily the document itself, more the process, raising questions such as:
* Why do we bother, no one reads them anyway?
* Why do we bother, as soon as I start coding, the document is out-of-date?
* Why do we bother, I might as well get straight into coding and work out the problems as I go along?</p>

<p>All of these are good questions, but IMHO, they all miss the main purposes of the process; to communicate and analyse.</p>

<p>[Where I do have a problem with hand-written documentation is when it is merely repeating information from elsewhere.  This is especially true for API documentation and Test documentation.  Both of these should be driven by a comment markup system direct from the code/tests - Doxygen, Sandcastle, etc.]</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m collabaritively working on a very complex piece of software at the moment.  Before we started coding, we created a 1-2 page summary document, detailing: Background, Stakeholders, Expectations, Timeframe.  This is important, as it not only sets expectations, but also helps us to clarify what we are trying to achieve (to make sure we don&rsquo;t build the wrong solution).  Once we understood the problem, and the expectations, we started work on the design.  Within a few days we&rsquo;d sketched out a 20 page (mostly diagrams - using PowerPoint) design summary, showing what the system did.  This was followed by a spreadsheet which nicely captured our decision logic, depending on the state and action.</p>

<p>It only took a few days to get this far, but during that timeframe it has already gone through a number of iterations - and has changed again since we started coding.  By keeping the information simple and freeform, we have been able to easily edit it, and re-analyze the entire system without thinking about syntactic and semantic code issues.  If we were to have gone straight to coding, we would probably be 2-3 weeks behind where we are now - and we would be much more reluctant to make large changes.</p>

<p>Being clear and concise is key to good technical documentaiton.  However, the most important thing, just like with code, is making the document easy to maintain!</p>

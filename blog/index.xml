      <description>Introduction Last time I switch the design of my blog, I switched to Hugo. After a bit of theme customization I had a pretty good working system. However, it didn&amp;rsquo;t take long until I tweaked one of the static generated output files.
This tweaking continued for the next few years&amp;hellip; until now.
I&amp;rsquo;ve stuck with Hugo, but have chosen a different theme and made my customizations - mostly to make it work like a fully functioning website (with a blog), and not just a &amp;lsquo;single page site&amp;rsquo;, or a &amp;lsquo;blog with an simple about page&amp;rsquo;.</description>

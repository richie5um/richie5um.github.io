      <description>Hi.
I live and work near Manchester, UK.
For work, I&amp;rsquo;m a Principal Software Engineer at Ivanti (nee LANDESK, nee AppSense) mostly working on shipping v1 products - the three most recent projects have involved; cloud technologies (AWS, Azure), web-UI, web-services, and Windows/Mac agents. I love the dynamic and creative nature when collaborating with a team to birth new v1 products.
Previously at AppSense I was Head of Research; leading a small, skilled team to identify and solve complex problems, and explore next generation markets and technologies.</description>

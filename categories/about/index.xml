      <description>Hi.
I live and work near Manchester, UK.
For work, I&amp;rsquo;m a CTO at Summize working on Legal Contract Management solution. I love the dynamic and creative nature when collaborating with a team to birth new v1 products.
Previously at AppSense/Ivanti I was Head of Research; leading a small, skilled team to identify and solve complex problems, and explore next generation markets and technologies. As exciting and free as that role was, shipping real software to real users is what I enjoy most.</description>
